\chapter{Experiments}
Describe the evaluation you did in a way, such that an independent researcher can repeat it. Cover the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{What is the experimental setup and methodology?} Describe the setting of the experiments and give all the parameters you have used in detail. Give a detailed account of how the experiment was conducted.
 \item \textit{What are your results?} In this section, a \emph{clear description} of the results is given. If you produced lots of data, include only representative data here and put all results into the appendix. 
\end{itemize}
