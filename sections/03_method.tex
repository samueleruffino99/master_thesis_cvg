\chapter{Method}
The objectives of the Method section are the following: 
\begin{itemize}
 
 \item \textit{What problem are you solving?} Give a clear, formalized statement of the problem you are solving, \ie which inputs are given, which assumptions you make, and what is the desired output (goal).
 \item \textit{What are the preliminaries of your work?} Introduce the environment in which your work has taken place - this can be a software package, a device, or a system description. Ensure sufficiently detailed descriptions of the algorithms and concepts (e.g. math) you used.
 \item \textit{What is your work?} Describe the key component of your work, e.g. an algorithm or software framework you have developed.
\end{itemize}
